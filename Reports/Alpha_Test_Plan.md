# Alpha Test Plan   

By David Hutchins, Austin Welch, Branden Evangelista, and BrontÃ« Cadogan

## Specification

### Usability
#### Interface
For this alpha build, the web application pages have been updated, both in functionality and design. The statistics page has been revamped to display a line graph of the number of operations (i.e. the number of times the devices collectively trigger a UVC-light to turn on) over time. The statistics page also includes a pie chart to show the number of times each device (that is connected to the web application) is activated per week. The data to form these plots are pulled from a MongoDB database; the microcontroller(s) write to this database whenever the motion sensor triggers an interrupt to turn on the UVC-light. The setup guide page leads to a PDF that shows how to use our product; this PDF has been updated to show the instructions for building the web application on a local machine (instructions also included at the end of this report).

Interfacing with the UVC-light simply requires a hand motion in front of the motion sensor; the light will toggle on and off depending on whether a person's hand is in front of said sensor. The details outlining the sanitation process is in the "Responsiveness" section of this report.

For future iterations of the project, we should be able to connect more than one microcontroller to this web application and have these multiple devices write to the database concurrently.

#### Navigation
The web application is easy to navigate due to the navigation bar at the top of the web page. Users can switch between the home page, statistics page, setup guide page, and device connection page using this navigation bar.

For future builds, the UI will continue to be updated and will focus on the readability of data coming from the microcontroller. The web application will also aim to read connections from multiple devices.
#### Perception
The current iteration of the hardware (i.e. the microcontroller's connection to the WiFi backpack, bluetooth receiver, UVC-light, and motion sensor) are all connected on a breadboard. For future iterations, this breadboard will be consolidated into one PCB board; this board and our external power source will then be placed in a custom-made housing unit for a more simplistic look.

The product itself should be intuitive in design; users simply need to wave their hand in front of the motion sensor (which will be placed near a door handle) to activate the product's sanitation mode. Any interactions with the hardware will be documented on the web application's "Statistic" page. The data recorded by each microcontroller is consolidated in the statistic page's line graph and pie chart.

#### Responsiveness
The external interface makes use of hardware interrupts and software timers to control the use of the UVC-light. Whenever the motion sensor detects motion near the door handle, an interrupt will be triggered to tell the microcontroller to turn off the UVC-light. As long as the user's hand is over the sensor (or there is constant movement near the motion sensor), the UVC-light should turn off, representing the "safety mode" of the system. Once the user takes their hand away from the sensor, another interrupt will be triggered, turning the UVC-light back on. A software timer is then triggered, allowing the UVC to stay on for four seconds before turning back off again. This process is nearly the same as in the prototype; however, for this alpha build, we have incorporated the UVC-light and connected it to a MOSFET transistor. The MOSFET transistor acts like a switch, allowing us to control when the UVC-light will turn on and off (via the interrupts).

For future builds, this process will move from the breadboard to a PCB, which not only cleans up the aesthetic of the product.

## Build Instructions
### Install CCS
1. Download CCS from https://www.ti.com/tool/download/CCSTUDIO
2. Proceed through the installer, when asked to select between full and custom installation, choose custom and click next
3. On 'Select Components' Select 'SimpleLink MSP432 low power + performance MCUs'
4. On the next page, select only 'Spectrum Digital Debug Probes and Boards'
5. Proceed until program is installed

### In CCS
1. Go to File > Import 
2. Choose Code Composer Studio > CCS Projects
3. Clone/Download the repository and select Hardware > Hand-Sanitizing-System as the search directory
4. Select Hand-Sanitizing-System_MSP432 and Finish
5. Hit the hammer icon on the top left bar to build the project (if it is not compiling, ensure that (Active - Debug) appears next to the project name on the project explorer, you can do this by clicking on the project, which 'selects' it as the build target)

## Running the Automatic Hand Cleaning System App (Webapp) on a Local Machine
1. Make sure NodeJS is installed https://nodejs.org/en/
2. Download the repo from GitHub using 
    `git clone https://github.com/davidhutchins/Automatic-Sanitizing-System.git`
3. Install dependencies using: `npm i`
4. Open the command prompt and navigate to the folder containing the server.js file:
   `cd Automatic-Sanitizing-System/Server/sanitizingsystem/src/server`
5. Enter the command `node server.js` to connect to the MongoDB database
6. In another terminal, navigate to this folder:
   `cd Automatic-Sanitizing-System/Server/sanitizingsystem/src`
and run the application with `npm start`
